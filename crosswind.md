## 🚀 Overview

**Crosswind Console** is a next-generation **AI Orchestration Platform** built for speed, depth, and precision. It leverages **LangChain 1.2** and **Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview** to coordinate a fleet of specialized agents that can "think" and "act" using real-time tools.

Unlike generic chatbots, Crosswind uses a **Hybrid RAG + MCP Architecture**:
1.  **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Injects deep domain knowledge (API manuals, travel guides) into the AI's context.
2.  **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Connects the AI to 120+ real-time tools (Amadeus, Flights Sky, Booking.com) via a persistent, high-performance connection pool.

> **Performance Upgrade (Jan 2026)**: Now featuring a custom HTTP MCP client that reduces tool execution latency from **60s to <3s**.
